# Portfolio
Old Personal Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio website containing information about me! It is a single page application with admin rights for content management used to control the content on the page. It is built using vanilla Javascript and node with some bootstrap styling functionality between mobile and desktop. There are six main components to this website, welcome, projects, navigation bar, experience, about, and contact. The user is welcomed to the welcome content section with the navigation bar sitting statically on the left hand side of the page. The user can either scroll down to the next section or use the navigation bar to navigate to the various page sections. Under the welcome section there is a projects section that is displayed in a carousel manner, where the the user can click next and previous to cycle the elements. Experience below that and is also a carousel just like projects. Below experience is the about section that contains cards that hold a title and description that is used to display various other content besides projects and experience. The last thing on the page is the contact section that contains footer content and a form to contact me. 

If the user clicks on the stamp found at the bottom of the page it will open a login form where they are prompted to enter in a username and password. If valid then it will reload the page that now includes the admin content allowing the user to add, update, and delete page content and have the changes be applied in real time. 

To run the project:
1. Clone the repository

2. Navigate to the folder 'server' via command prompt or terminal

3. run "node index.js"
